Installing MySQL Workbench

Starting the Server from within Workbench. (see "Step 0" image)
1. Go to the "Server" menu and choose "Startup/Shutdown" or choose the Startup/Shutdown option in the sidebar under "Instance"
2. Press the "Start Server" button

Importing the Database (this assumes you have downloaded the provided file)
1. Go to the "Server" menu and choose "Data Import" (see step 1 image)
2. Choose the downloaded FarmersMarketDatabase.sql file from the folder you downloaded it to. The script has the schema creation built in and will create a schema called farmers_market, so you don't need to enter a target schema. (see step 2 image)
3. Scroll down and click the "Start Import" button.
4. After the database has restored, you can open a new SQL tab (use the first icon, which is labeled with the word SQL and +), and start writing and running queries.


Note: The accompanying figures are from MySQL Workbench 8.0.
